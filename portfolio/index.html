                        (2022)</a><br>Video,
                    9:42<br>A desktop documentary about an attempt to modify the relationships between police officers
                    in the
                    popular video game Grand Theft Auto V. The flexibility of the game world makes it possible to fire
                    vehicles
                    from weapons,
                    teleport to any location,
                    and modify the textures of billboards. The relationships between police officers in the game,
                    however,
                    are immutable. It is this unbreakable rule within the simulation of the urban environment that
                    betrays the
                    game’s deep sociopolitical assumptions.<br>Password: ursulaleguinn </li>

                    (Non-durational software-generated audiovisual environment)<br>A live simulation about indeterminacy
                    and
                    contemporary computing. It speaks to issues surrounding encryption and the political economy of
                    random
                    numbers,
                    using randomness to drive a narrative taking place on a computer desktop. The piece is infinite in
                    duration,
                    constructed in realtime along with a generative soundscape by Ron Shalom. </li>

                        Network
                        (2021)</a><br>This video charts the artist's production of a neural network which uses machine
                    learning
                    to do simple
                    addition. This absurd and rather useless task becomes a way to demystify the black box operations of
                    machine
                    learning algorithms and explore what we imply when we talk about precision,
                    accuracy,
                    and optimization. </li>
