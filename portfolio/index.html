                (2022)</a><br>Video,
            9:42<br>A desktop documentary about an attempt to modify the relationships between police officers in the
            popular video game Grand Theft Auto V. The flexibility of the game world makes it possible to fire vehicles
            from weapons,
            teleport to any location,
            and modify the textures of billboards. The relationships between police officers in the game,
            however,
            are immutable. It is this unbreakable rule within the simulation of the urban environment that betrays the
            game’s deep sociopolitical assumptions.<br>Password: ursulaleguinn </li>

            (Non-durational software-generated audiovisual environment)<br>A live simulation about indeterminacy and
            contemporary computing. It speaks to issues surrounding encryption and the political economy of random
            numbers,
            using randomness to drive a narrative taking place on a computer desktop. The piece is infinite in duration,
            constructed in realtime along with a generative soundscape by Ron Shalom. </li>

                (2021)</a><br>This video charts the artist's production of a neural network which uses machine learning
            to do simple
            addition. This absurd and rather useless task becomes a way to demystify the black box operations of machine
            learning algorithms and explore what we imply when we talk about precision,
            accuracy,
            and optimization. </li>
