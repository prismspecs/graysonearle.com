            <p>Grayson Earle is a contemporary artist and activist whose work critically examines digital technologies
                and
                political agency. Born in the United States and currently based in Berlin, Earle reveals the hidden
                politics embedded in technology, centering on themes of labor, surveillance, and resistance.</p>

            <p>Earle is known for his involvement in The Illuminator, a guerrilla projection collective amplifying
                social
                justice movements in public space, and for his creation of Bail Bloc, automated software that mined
                cryptocurrency to post bail for low-income individuals in New York City. His film Why don't the cops
                fight
                each other? dissects the source code governing police behavior in video games, critiquing systemic power
                structures. The film has screened internationally at SXSW, Oberhausen Film Festival, the Australian
                Centre
                for the Moving Image, and Busan International Video Arts Festival, among others.</p>

            <p>Earle has participated in residencies including <a href="https://www.akademie-solitude.de/">Akademie
                    Schloss Solitude</a> and BPA// Berlin program for artists. He is a current artist in residence at
                Braunschweig Projects and a scholarship recipient in Critical Philosophy at <a
                    href="https://thenewcentre.org/">The New Centre for Research &amp; Practice</a>. His work has been
                presented at the Whitney Museum of American Art, KW Institute for Contemporary Art, and Singapore Art
                Museum. His recent project Return to Sender employs GPS trackers and hidden audio recorders to map
                Amazon's opaque logistics network, exposing the labor and environmental costs of corporate efficiency.
                Combining investigative rigor with artistic innovation, Earle's practice transforms systemic critique
                into
                accessible and provocative experiences.</p>
