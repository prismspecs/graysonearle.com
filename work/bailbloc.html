            <h2>Bail Bloc</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Bail Bloc</strong> is a project that turns unused computer processing power into
                tangible action against systemic injustice. By mining Monero cryptocurrency, Bail Bloc generates funds
                to post bail for individuals in ICE detention, allowing them to fight their cases from outside the
                system of forced detention.
            </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                When you download and run the Bail Bloc app, a small portion of your computer's unused processing power
                is used to mine Monero, a secure and private cryptocurrency. Every month, the Monero is converted into
                US dollars and donated to the <a href="https://www.immigrantbailfund.org/home" target="_blank">Immigrant
                    Bail Fund</a>, which uses it to post bond for people in ICE detention. 100% of the funds go directly
                to those in need.
            </p>

            <h3>The Need for Bail Bloc</h3>
            <p>
                Immigration bonds in the US are disproportionately high, with the median bond in Connecticut at $15,000,
                nearly double the national average. Many individuals are forced to remain in detention simply because
                they cannot afford bond. This project highlights the cruel nature of the cash bail system and works to
                alleviate its effects.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Since its launch, Bail Bloc has raised over $5,000 in just two months, helping individuals secure their
                freedom and fight deportation from outside detention. The project continues to grow, turning passive
                participation into an impactful abolitionist effort.
