            <h2>Return to Sender</h2>
            <p>"Return to Sender" is a political art project designed to unveil the hidden logistics networks behind
                Amazon's returns process, highlighting the labor and environmental impacts involved. Participants will
                purchase GPS tracking devices and return them to Amazon from different locations across the United
                States. By tracing the path these devices take back to warehouses or repair sites, the project seeks to
                disrupt the conventional consumer-worker relationship and foster new forms of solidarity.</p>

            <p>The project involves both a practical component and a symbolic gesture. Participants are encouraged to
                include a letter addressed to a worker within the return package, expressing care and support. This act
                challenges the anonymity and invisibility often associated with corporate logistics, and serves as a
                reminder of the human element within these systems.</p>

            <p>"Return to Sender" aims to challenge the status quo of corporate logistics, advocating for broader
                political goals such as regional unionization efforts and the nationalization of corporate giants like
                Amazon. The project's Supply Chain Manifest tool will chart the journey of each returned package, making
                visible the various warehouses, repair sites, and waste disposal locations involved in Amazon's
                logistics
                process. Through this, the project seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked labor and environmental
                repercussions of our consumer habits, encouraging a more informed and conscientious public.</p>

            <h2>Amazon Return with a Recording Device Inside</h2>
            <p>Exhibited as part of this project is a solo work which consists of returning a smart phone purchased from
                Amazon.de. The device was altered to record 52 hours of transit to its eventual destination and transmit
                the audio back to me over the cell network. <a href="box.html">View that work here</a>.</p>
